# This repo contains a boiler plate code for node js.

This code is compatible with node v16.16.0
Use: nvm use v16.16.0 to set node version
and then: npm start to start server

For some reason in node20 it is giving:  
TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension ".ts" for /Users/yash/Documents/code/node-boilerplate/src/server.ts

For Debugging:  
Use Javascript Debug Terminal  
And in the JS terminal update the node version to v16.16.0 and then run npm start to  
start the server in debug mode.
